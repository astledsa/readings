    The Library
  </h1>
  <p>
    This site was made because I got addicted to making pretty single page index.html sites for small things. Might end up with 
    a collection of such sites, check out my <a href="https://twitter.com/AstleDsa">twitter</a> profile for more! Feels like an art, to be able to "paint" such sites with
    no framework or library, just a single file of artistry. Anyways, below is a list of things I've read over the years cause
    why not. Hopefully this list continues to grow!
